# AI_search-
This program can generate problem states and search through them. Anything that implements the problem interface can be used with it. The states can be searched through using a depth first search, breadth first search, iterative deepening, or if a heuristic is used an A* search. The included problems are the farmer, wolf, grain, and chicken needing to cross a river two at a time, and the sliding 8 puzzle.
